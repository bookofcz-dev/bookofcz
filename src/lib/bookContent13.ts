    title: "Book of CZ ($BOCZ) Whitepaper",
    chapter: "Abstract",
    content: `The Book of CZ ($BOCZ) project is a community-driven initiative inspired by Changpeng Zhao (CZ), the visionary founder of Binance. Launched on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), $BOCZ serves as the native utility token for the world's first decentralized digital book marketplace. This platform empowers authors, creators, and readers to buy, sell, and trade digital books and crypto-related wisdom in a trustless, Web3-native environment. By combining meme culture with real-world utility, $BOCZ aims to bridge traditional publishing with blockchain technology, fostering education, innovation, and financial freedom. As CZ prepares to release his own book, $BOCZ positions itself as the ideal decentralized hub for its distribution and beyond, driving mass adoption in the crypto space.`

    title: "Project Overview",
    chapter: "Introduction",
    content: `Book of CZ draws inspiration from CZ's philosophy of transparency, humility, and building for the long term. The project supports CZ's vision by creating a decentralized ecosystem where knowledge—particularly in crypto, finance, and personal development—can be shared freely without intermediaries. The core offering is a digital book marketplace on BSC, where users can upload, sell, and purchase books using cryptocurrencies like $BOCZ, BNB, and USDT.

Launched on October 13, 2025, $BOCZ has quickly gained traction as a meme token with substantial utility. It emphasizes community governance, secure transactions, and creator empowerment. The project's slogan, "The next chapter in the Book of CZ," reflects its ambition to become the go-to platform for CZ's upcoming book and similar content.`

    title: "Problem Statement",
    chapter: "Introduction",
    content: `Traditional publishing is plagued by centralization: high fees from platforms like Amazon, limited access for independent authors, censorship risks, and slow royalty payments. In the crypto world, knowledge sharing often relies on fragmented social media or paywalled sites, lacking true ownership and decentralization. Authors struggle with monetization, while readers face barriers to accessing affordable, borderless content. Additionally, meme tokens often lack real utility, leading to short-lived hype without sustainable value.`

  {
    title: "Solution",
    chapter: "Introduction",
    content: `$BOCZ addresses these issues through a fully decentralized marketplace built on BSC for low fees and high scalability. Authors earn instantly in crypto, readers gain token-gated access to exclusive content, and the community governs the platform via DAO. By integrating swaps, governance, and content gating, $BOCZ creates a self-sustaining ecosystem that rewards holders and participants.`
