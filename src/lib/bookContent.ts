  },
  {

  },
  {
    title: "Family's Concern",
    content: `His family thought he was crazy. Selling his home to buy digital tokens that most people had never heard of? It seemed like financial suicide.

  },
  {
    title: "The Gaps in the Market",
    content: `While at OKCoin, CZ began to notice gaps in the market. Existing exchanges had problems—they were slow, often went down during high-volume periods, had poor user interfaces, and charged high fees.

He believed he could build something better. An exchange that was faster, more reliable, and more user-friendly. An exchange that could handle any volume without breaking down.`,
  },
  {
    title: "The Vision for Binance",
    content: `The vision for Binance began to take shape. CZ imagined an exchange that could process 1.4 million transactions per second. An exchange that would never go down. An exchange with the lowest fees in the industry.

More than that, he envisioned a complete ecosystem—not just trading, but lending, staking, savings, and eventually even its own blockchain.`,
  },
  {
    title: "Assembling the Team",
    content: `CZ knew he couldn't do it alone. He began quietly assembling a team of talented developers, traders, and business professionals. He needed people who shared his vision and his work ethic.

One key recruit was Yi He, who became his business partner and later, his life partner. Together, they began planning what would become the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange.`,
  },
  {
    title: "The ICO Decision",
    content: `To fund Binance, CZ decided to launch an Initial Coin Offering (ICO). This was 2017, the height of the ICO boom, and it was the perfect time.

  },
  {
    title: "Exchange Launch",
    content: `Just eleven days after the ICO concluded, on July 14, 2017, Binance opened for trading. This rapid launch shocked the industry—most exchanges took months or years to develop.

The initial offering was modest—just a handful of trading pairs. But the platform was fast, stable, and user-friendly. Early users were impressed.`,
  },
  {
    title: "Early Adoption",
    content: `In its first month, Binance attracted thousands of users. Word spread quickly in the crypto community: there was a new exchange, and it was good.

The platform's speed was remarkable. While other exchanges froze during high-volume periods, Binance kept running. CZ's years of experience building high-frequency trading systems were paying off.`,
  },
  {
    title: "The First Crisis",
    content: `Success brought its own challenges. As volume increased, the team faced scaling issues they hadn't anticipated. There were bugs to fix, servers to upgrade, and customer support tickets to answer.

  },
  {
    title: "Rapid Growth",
    content: `By the end of 2017, Binance was processing hundreds of millions of dollars in daily trading volume. New users were joining by the thousands every day.

The crypto market was in a bull run, and Binance was perfectly positioned to capitalize on it. More trading pairs were added. More features were developed.`,
  },
  {
    title: "The Crowning Achievement",
    content: `In less than eight months after launch, in early 2018, Binance became the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume.

This was unprecedented growth. No exchange in history—crypto or traditional—had grown so fast. CZ's vision had become reality, but this was just the beginning.`,
  },
  {
    title: "BNB's Rise",
    content: `Binance Coin (BNB), the utility token launched with the exchange, also soared in value. What started as a simple token for fee discounts was becoming valuable in its own right.

CZ began expanding BNB's use cases. It could be used to buy virtual gifts, pay for travel bookings, and make purchases at various online stores.`,
  },
  {
    title: "Hack Attempt",
    content: `In March 2018, Binance faced a major security challenge. Hackers attempted a sophisticated attack, using phishing to gain access to user accounts.

The attack was detected and stopped before significant damage occurred. But it was a wake-up call. Security had to be even tighter.`,
  },
  {
    title: "Security Overhaul",
    content: `After the hack attempt, CZ invested heavily in security. The team implemented advanced monitoring systems, enhanced encryption, and additional verification processes.

They also created SAFU (Secure Asset Fund for Users), dedicating 10% of all trading fees to an emergency insurance fund. If users ever lost funds due to a security breach, SAFU would compensate them.`,
  },
  {
    title: "Global Expansion",
    content: `Binance wasn't just growing in volume—it was expanding globally. CZ opened offices in multiple countries, hired teams around the world, and added support for dozens of languages.

  },
  {
    title: "Regulatory Challenges Begin",
    content: `As Binance grew, it began attracting regulatory attention. Different countries had different rules about cryptocurrency exchanges, and navigating this landscape was complex.

Some countries welcomed Binance. Others demanded strict compliance. Some banned it outright. CZ had to become as skilled at regulatory navigation as he was at technology.`,
  },
  {
    title: "The Decentralized Approach",
    content: `CZ made a controversial decision: Binance wouldn't have a fixed headquarters. The company would be decentralized, with teams operating from multiple locations.

This was partly practical—it allowed them to operate globally without being tied to one jurisdiction's rules. But it was also philosophical—CZ believed in decentralization.`,
  },
  {
    title: "Binance Launchpad",
    content: `In 2019, Binance launched Binance Launchpad, a platform for helping cryptocurrency projects conduct token sales.

  },
  {
    title: "Smart Chain Vision",
    content: `CZ recognized that Ethereum's success with smart contracts and dApps represented the future of blockchain. But Ethereum was slow and expensive.

  },
  {
    title: "Binance.US",
    content: `Navigating U.S. regulations was particularly challenging. In 2019, CZ launched Binance.US, a separate entity operated by American partners and designed to comply with U.S. law.

This allowed Binance to maintain a presence in the crucial American market while the main platform continued serving users globally.`,
  },
  {
    title: "Forbes Recognition",
    content: `In February 2018, Forbes placed CZ third on their list of "The Richest People In Cryptocurrency," with an estimated net worth between $1.1 and $2 billion.

  },
  {
    title: "The Compliance Push",
    content: `In response, CZ announced a major compliance initiative. Binance would work with regulators, implement KYC (Know Your Customer) procedures, and obtain licenses where possible.
